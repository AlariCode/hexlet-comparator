# Hexlet Comparator

[![github action status](https://github.com/hexlet/hexlet-comparator/workflows/Main/badge.svg)](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/hexlet/hexlet-comparator/goto?ref=main)

An open project to compare programming courses from different schools. The comparison is made according to formal characteristics in order to avoid distortions. Only schools that have full professions, not just courses, are compared.

* Information about all the schools is in the /data
* If you fulfill CEO of the school, you can give links to FB or VK (or empty link to any of them)

## Pictures

The pictures of the schools are in the */public/assets/schools*

* Logo - svg format, transparent background
* Screenshot - jpg format. Add screenshots of internal screens, primarily related to the learning process and interaction. External landings are not needed, they have no value. Screenshots must be taken on a MacBook with a Retina display with a 16:10 aspect ratio.

To take a screenshot properly, you need to go into the Safari browser on a Retina Mac. In the settings, uncheck the “Always Show Toolbar in Full Screen” checkbox. Take a screenshot of the page and add it to your project.
